# Traffic Incident Prediction and Analysis

A comprehensive solution for predicting and analyzing traffic incidents using external APIs, machine learning, and FastAPI. This application fetches real-time or historical weather data, retrieves route/geospatial details, processes that information through a trained model, and exposes predictions and analytics through a REST API.

## 1. Overview

This repository hosts a FastAPI-based service that forecasts or analyzes traffic incidents. By combining weather conditions, location-based routing data, and historical traffic patterns, the application aims to give real-time or near real-time predictions for potential accidents, congestion, or other noteworthy incidents.

Example uses:

- City or state authorities wanting to predict high-risk areas for traffic accidents based on weather  
- Navigation providers looking to warn drivers of potential delays or hazards  
- Researchers studying correlations between environmental conditions and traffic incident patterns

## 2. Features

- **Weather Data Integration**  
  Retrieves real-time and/or historical weather data via [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Meteostat](https://dev.meteostat.net/).  
  - Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc., are used as inputs to the traffic incident model

- **Routing and Geospatial Data**  
  Uses [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/) (ORS) to obtain route details, distances, or geocoding data, which may inform location-based incident forecasting

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  A scikit-learn model (stored in `./data/model.pkl` by default) generates a probability or classification of potential traffic incidents. You can update or retrain this model as new data becomes available

- **FastAPI Microservice**  
  A modern REST API with documented endpoints (via OpenAPI/Swagger UI) that accepts requests (e.g., weather or route queries) and returns predictions or other analytics

- **Extensible**  
  You can seamlessly integrate additional data sources or swap out the machine learning model for more advanced solutions (XGBoost, PyTorch, etc.) as your needs evolve

1. **FastAPI** handles incoming requests (for predictions or analytics).  
2. **External APIs** (OpenWeatherMap, Meteostat, ORS) supply data.  
3. **ML Model** uses combined data (weather, routes, historical incidents) to produce predictions, which are then returned as JSON responses.
